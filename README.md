# LearningReact
Trying to save some ideas here, mini apps organized and deployed in one repo.
I'll try to use only one css framework that I want to learn - tailwind css.


Full project is deployed on github pages: https://papyszoo.github.io/TestingReact/
Using HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter because it is not supported by github pages.

ContactsList and FilteredUsersList code is from https://typeofweb.com/wprowadzenie-kurs-react-js/ react course.
